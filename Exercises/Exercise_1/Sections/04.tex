\section{Problem 4}
This problem will simulate a diode using AIM-spice. All simulations should be performed
at room temperature ($27^o$).

\subsection*{a) Describe the circuit of Figure \ref*{fig:pn-junction} in AIM-Spice using the diode model ‘DBSBdiode.mod’ found on blackboard. The model files found on blackboard models a $100 \mu m$ x $100 \mu m$ diode}
