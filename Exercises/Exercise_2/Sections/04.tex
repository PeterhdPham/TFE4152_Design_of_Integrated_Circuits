\section{Problem 4}
This problem includes elements from a chip layout where the PMOS transistors are found within the pink rectangle in the layout in Figure \ref{fig:CMOS.png}. The substrate is assumed to be of p-type and standard bulk CMOS technology is used. Can you draw the transistor schematics for a circuit that the layout illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:CMOS.png} could represent?
